# CPU-scheduler-Simulator
 The idea of the project is to receive a list of processes (fixed to 5 processes) with
different arrival times and different CPU bursts. Also each process will have a size in
bytes .

• You should write a program that will read these processes from a file called
processes.txt that contains the list of process that should be scheduled.

• Your simulator should build the PCB for each process with required data structure.
Your design for the PCB should be clear and clarified inside the source code of your
simulator or as a sperate documentation file using word or pdf format.

• Your simulator should be able to report the following results on the screen as soon
as the last process is finished running using FCFS, SJF (non-preemptive), and RR with
Q = y that will be given in the text file as well.

a.  A Gantt Chart that shows the execution times of the process.

b.  Finish time of each process, Waiting time for each process, Turnaround time
for each process. Assume a CS = x time units that will be input from the text file as
well.

c.  The averages of the required criteria’s in part a. Average Waiting Time ….

d.  The CPU utilization.
